By mid-season, the whitish fungus can be seen growing over the leaves and shoots, sometimes in patches and other times covering most of the new growth. Such symptoms are especially common in nursery trees. The growth of sour cherry trees in the nursery and in young orchards is reduced by this disease.',

Secondary spores produced in spring spread the fungus to new growth. Infections can be severe in commercial orchards during years of low rainfall, high humidity, and warm temperatures (70° to 80°F). The disease is particularly severe on new growth, such as shoots of inner scaffolds, and can infect fruit as well, causing direct crop loss. In warm, humid, coastal areas, powdery mildew can also be severe after harvest. Typically, it takes 1/10th of an inch of rain or irrigation and temperatures of 50°F or more for spring primary infections to occur. Warm temperatures without rain, but with sufficiently high humidity for morning fog or dews, are ideal for a rapid increase of the disease.',

Preventing or minimizing primary infections of foliage is important to prevent fruit infection later in the season. Continue fungicide coverage until harvest. Adjust spray intervals as needed depending on the rate of shoot growth, fungicides selected and weather conditions. More sprays will be needed in wet years than dry years. Consider post-harvest application of fungicides to prevent buildup of mildew on foliage and reduce the amount of overwintering inoculum.  For these late season sprays it is best to select products that have a low risk of resistance, such as sulphur, bicarbonates or summer oil.',
