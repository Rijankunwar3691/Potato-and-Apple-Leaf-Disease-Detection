            ' All corn hybrids and inbreds are susceptible to Gray Leaf Spot (GLS). In minimum tillage fields with a history of GLS, symptoms can occur on the lower leaves prior to tasseling. Immature GLS lesions can be easily confused with lesions caused by other pathogens; e.g., eyespot (Kabatiella), anthracnose (Colletrichum). Mature lesions on leaves are rectangular in shape and restricted by leaf veins; reverse lighting reveals a yellow halo on most hybrids. Mature lesions are diagnostic and easily distinguishable from other diseases. As lesions expand they coalesce resulting in a blighting of large portions of the leaf. When the source of primary innoculum is within the field, symptoms originate on the lower leaves and progress up the plant as infection cycles occur. When severe, the entire plant may be blighted. Stalk infections have been reported and can result in lodging if severe. Lesions on sheath or husk tissues may be be oval to ellipsoidal in shape and are not usually diagnostic. Severely affected fields can appear to be experiencing early dry-down. The time from infection to the production of more innoculum can be 14-21 days on a susceptible hybrid and 21-28 days on a tolerant hybrid. .',

This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation. High risks for corn grey leaf spot are divided into eight factors, which require specific management strategies. \n\n1. Susceptible hybrid.\n\n2.Continuous corn.\n\n3.Late planting date.\n\n4.Minimum tillage systems .\n\n5.Field history of severe disease.\n\n6.Early disease activity (before tasseling.\n\n7.rrigation and Favorable weather forecast for disease. \n\n There are currently three different management strategies, some of which are more effective than others.\n\n1.Resistant varieties: In places where leaf spot occur, these crops can ultimately grow and still be resistant to the disease. Although the disease is not completely eliminated and resistant varieties show disease symptoms, at the end of the growing season, the disease is not as effective in reducing crop yield\n\n2.Crop rotation: The amount of initial inoculum will be reduced when a crop other than corn is planted for ≥2 years in that given area; meanwhile proper tillage methods are carried out\n\n3.Residue management: Burying the debris under the last year’s crop will help in reducing the presence of Cercospera zeae-maydis, as the fungal-infected debris can only survive above the soil surface.',
